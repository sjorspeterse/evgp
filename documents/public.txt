As I thought about the various pages I realized the public one is perhaps the easiest because there is little interaction.  Please see the attachment.

 

Some details:

 

1. Left section with flags.  The flags that are active at any given moment will flash on and off

 

2. The score board is clear.  Only thing is there is a scroll bar on the right to move up and down in case we can’t fit all the teams on the screen.  The table headings remain fixed, just the team lines move.

 

3. Bottom left:  this displays the last set of penalties and delays.  As a new one comes in the oldest one gets bumped.

 

4. Track: this would display the dots with numbers based on a 2-axis grid.  So it reads (x,y) coordinate of each one every time step and places it there.  Sometimes they will cover each other but it’s ok because each car will hopefully have a different line and speed selections so it will not be covered for very long

 

I am thinking we also add a section below this that just lists all the penalties and delays since there will be a lot of them to fit in the box (point 3. above) so people can scroll down the entire page and see this information.  We also can put sponsors and other event details below when people scroll down.

 

What do you think?
